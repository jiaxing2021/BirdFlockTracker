# Bird Group Tracking with Gaussian Modeling

This project implements an algorithm to automatically track a group of birds in real-time using YOLO for detection, clustering and Gaussian modeling for robust tracking, and bounding square visualization for camera control.

## Features
- YOLO-based bird detection
- DBSCAN clustering and outlier removal
- 2D Gaussian distribution fitting
- Axis-aligned bounding square for camera framing
- Visualization and video output support

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
- YOLO model (e.g., YOLOv8)

## Usage
See `main.py` for example usage.
